This event will not be a live stream on Youtube, but each section of the event will be uploaded over the next few days following the event close. Poll result will be saved and shared also.
Make sure to have any questions you may have ready for when we open the floor as only 5 minutes per person will be allotted. So if you take 4 minutes to explain we will only have a
minute to answer as we would like to keep things moving and give as many people to speak a chance. We will not be diving into showing you how to code but more about pointing you in the
right direction. Hope to see you there!
