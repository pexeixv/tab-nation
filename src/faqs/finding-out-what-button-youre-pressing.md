question: Finding Out What Button You're Pressing (JoyPad, Random Keyboard Keys, Surface Pro Stylus, etc...)
index: 6
---

A lot of times, people need to find out how to use a specific button. It might be on a controller, or it might be some extra mouse button or an extra key on your keyboard. We also see a lot of Surface Pro Stylus questions. So here a couple ways to help you identify what button you're pressing.
It should be noted that NOT ALL BUTTONS/KEYS CAN BE DETECTED!!! Remember that.

Option 1 - Keyboard Hook Method

Make this into a script:

```
#Persistent 
#InstallKeybdHook 
#InstallMouseHook
```
Now double-click on the script icon in your system tray (Or right-click then click "Open").

Click "View" then "Key History and Script Info".

You can now press whatever buttons you're trying to identify. Press them a few times, then press F5 to refresh the Key History.
I chose to click my left mouse button and then type "autohotkey"

You should see something like this:

```
Window: D:\Scripts\AHK\Del.ahk - AutoHotkey v1.1.23.01
Keybd hook: yes
Mouse hook: yes
Enabled Timers: 0 of 0 ()
Interrupted threads: 0
Paused threads: 0 of 0 (0 layers)
Modifiers (GetKeyState() now) = 
Modifiers (Hook's Logical) = 
Modifiers (Hook's Physical) = 
Prefix key is down: no
The oldest are listed first.  VK=Virtual Key, SC=Scan Code,
Elapsed=Seconds since the previous event. 
Types: h=Hook Hotkey, s=Suppressed (blocked),
i=Ignored because it was generated by an AHK script,
a=Artificial, #=Disabled via #IfWinActive/Exist,
U=Unicode character (SendInput).

VK  SC    Type    Up/Dn    Elapsed    Key        Window
---------------------------------------------------------
01  000   d   1.19    LButton            
01  000   u   0.05    LButton            
41  01E   d   1.50    a                  
41  01E   u   0.11    a                  
55  016   d   0.16    u                  
55  016   u   0.08    u                  
```

You can use those VKs (virtual keys) and SCs (scan codes) in a script now. If I wanted my "a" key to make a message box pop up, I can do it with the VK or the SC like this:

```
vk41::  
   MsgBox VK Hello! 
return
```

```
sc01E::   
  MsgBox SC Hello! 
return
```
